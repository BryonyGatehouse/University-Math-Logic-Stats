# Engineering Mathematics with Logic and Statistics
Mathematical techniques employed by network and software engineers, including methods of combinatorics, logic, probability and decision theory. The course emphasises engineering applications of these techniques.

### Course content
This course covers ideas in logic, combinatorics, probability and statistics. On the logic combinatorics side, we will study propositional logic, introductory graph theory, proofs, sets and relations, and induction and recursion. On the probability and statistics side, we will study data and sampling, probabilities and random variables, estimation and confidence intervals, and model fitting.
### Course learning objectives
Students who pass this course should be able to:
1. Know the important definitions and results in introductory logics and statistics.
2. Understand their significance to computer science and dealing with data.
3. Demonstrate your understanding by stating definitions and results, and solving simple problems.
